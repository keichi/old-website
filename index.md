My current research topic is Message Passing Interface (MPI) and interconnection
networks of high-performance computing systems. I have been working on how to
dynamically control the interconnect based on the communication pattern of
MPI applications. I am also interested in other fields of parallel and
distributed computing as well.

Besides my main research project, I am part of a joint research project of
[TIS Inc.](https://www.tis.co.jp/) and Cybermedia Center towards building a
sharing economy platform for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. As the lead
developer of the project, my mission is to design and implement
proof-of-concept software. Some of the outcomes has been open sourced.

I have been working as a part-time programmer for more than 7 years.
During my carrier, I developed various kinds of software including image
analysis, signal processing, factory automation and  web applications. My past
works are exemplified by:

- Developing and implementing a rapid automatic segmentation algorithm of
  electron microscopic images
- Developing and implementing a real-time background removal algorithm for
  plasma emission monitoring software
- Reverse engineering the communication protocol of a proprietray USB pressure
  transducer
- Prototyping and implementing an user interface of a [custom web
  browser](http://www.fenrir-inc.com/jp/sleipnir/)
- Developing a framework on top of [Play](https://www.playframework.com/)
  to facilitate (and partly automate) developemnt of REST APIs

At our laboratory, I am responsible for the management of our servers and
networks. I have deployed and maintained a small-scale, but modern cluster
using technologies such as KVM, Docker, Dokku (PasS based on docker),
Prometheus (Server monitoring & alerting system), Grafana (Server metrics
visualization), Ansible, etc.
