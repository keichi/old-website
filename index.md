My main research topic is interconnection networks of high-performance
computer systems and Messge Passing Interface (MPI).

I am also part of a joint research project of [TIS](https://www.tis.co.jp/)
Inc. and Cybermedia Center, which targets Internet of Things (IoT).
I am leading a small team to develop proof-of-concept software. Some outcomes
are open sourced.

I have been working as a part-time programmer for more than 7 years.
During my carrier, I developed various kinds of software including image
analysis, signal processing, factory automation and  web applications. My past
works are exemplified by:

- Developing and implementing a rapid automatic segmentation algorithm of
  electron microscopic images
- Developing and implementing a real-time background removal algorithm for
  plasma emission monitoring software
- Reverse engineering the communication protocol of a proprietray USB pressure
  transducer
- Prototyping and implementing an user interface of a [custom web
  browser](http://www.fenrir-inc.com/jp/sleipnir/)
- Developing a framework on top of [Play](https://www.playframework.com/)
  to facilitate (and partly automate) developemnt of REST APIs

At my laboratory, I am responsible for the management of servers and networks.
I have designed and deployed a small-scale, but modern cluster using
technologies such as KVM, Docker, Dokku (PasS based on docker), Prometheus
(Server monitoring & alerting system), Grafana (Server metrics visualization),
Ansible, etc.
