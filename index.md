My current research topic include Message Passing Interface (MPI) and
interconnection networks of high-performance computing systems. Specifically,
I have been working on how to dynamically reconfigure the interconnect based
on the communication pattern of MPI applications. I am also interested in
other fields of parallel and distributed computing as well.

Besides my main research project, I am part of a joint research project of
[TIS Inc.](https://www.tis.co.jp/) and Cybermedia Center towards building a
sharing economy platform for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. As the lead
developer of the project, my mission is to design and implement
proof-of-concept software. Some of the outcomes has been open sourced.

I have been working as a part-time programmer for more than 7 years.
During my carrier, I designed and developed a wide variety of software
including image analysis, signal processing, factory automation, desktop and
web applications.
